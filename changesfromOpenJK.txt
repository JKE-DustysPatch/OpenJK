New Cvars
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
g_autoRoll - default=1, if 0 hold Use to roll
g_char_forcePowerMax - default=100, controls total player FP, requires level restart

g_saberDeflectAutoAim - if 0, blaster deflections must be aimed with crosshair, easier to aim with better Saber Defense
g_saberForceDrains - if 1 special moves drain the amount of FP of the cvar below, katas not affected
g_saberForceDrainAmount - if above cvar is 1, special moves drain this amount of FP, katas not affected

g_saberMoreRealistic - no longer write-protected
g_weaponVelocity, g_weaponAltVelocity - multiply the speed of most player and NPC weapon projectiles

Cheat Codes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- g_playerCheatPowers: 
If 1, player can auto-push explosives, always dodges sniper shots, has increased jumping ability and resistance to force powers. 
If 2, all previous effects plus FP usage is cut in half.
If 3, unlimited fp and take no fall damage
Set when before you load your game to get all effects. "iknowkungfu" now toggles g_playerCheatPowers to 1
- g_moonJump:
flip this on to do some crazy jumping.

Gameplay mechanics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Force powers (activated with g_forceNewPowers 1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Force Jump: height for all levels increased by 25%
- Force Pull: level 1 pulls weapons only, level 2 can knockdown, level 3 can pull toward you a little bit
- ***Force Sense: gives limited snipershot dodging ability (you might need to hold down Use)
- Force Speed: decreases FP cost of sniper shot dodging at Level 3 (for auto-dodging anyway)
- **Force Protect 1/2/3: gives only 10/20/40% damage reduction against saber attacks instead of 25/50/75%
- Force Heal: costs slightly fewer force points at Level 3

NPC AI
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NPC Jedi changes:
- smarter use of new JA abilities; only use Force Rage if close and have >25% HP, and only kick/use saber katas if close (except CLASS_REBORN, they like to taunt you and show off sometimes when far away)
- Less exploitable; if you disarm their saber throw (rather than just stand there), recover from knockdown faster, and activate their saber more quickly after being gripped/drained (all these effects generally increase with difficulty and NPC rank). Light Jedi don't attack surrendered/unarmed enemies (unless they have a dark side class like CLASS_REBORN, CLASS_DESANN etc.)
- Also, now have their level of acrobatics determined by their move stat; 3 allows rolls and lean dodges, 4 allows cartwheels and flipping out of knockdown, this way you can restrict an NPC to be less acrobatic and more "technical"

Force-only Cultists: react properly to explosives, sniper shots, and saber throws; *sometimes use quick punches if close, and in general try harder to dodge saber attacks/throws

CLASS_BOBA, CLASS_MANDA, and CLASS_COMMANDO: (these have NOT been thoroughly tested...)
- only an NPC with "undying 1" or the name boba_fett is invincible now
- CLASS_MANDA acts like CLASS_BOBA but without a jetpack
- CLASS_COMMANDO acts like CLASS_BOBA but without a jetpack or flamethrower

Multi-weapon system:
- NPCs should now change to the next best weapon they have when you disarm them
- the boba-based classes support most player weapons now, and weapons are chosen randomly (can have more than 1 similar type of weapon)

Other changes:
- Grenadier Grans will use Melee sometimes even if the player is using a saber
- **NPCs surrender more like JK2 (more consistent animation, once they decide to surrender near player they stay surrendered, but when you leave they will get sneaky)
- Allied NPCs receive 150%/125%/100% HP for Padawan/Jedi/Jedi Knight difficulties now instead of 100%/125%/150% like enemies
- Assassin Droids now fire even with their shields up
- Class_Rodian with E11, and Class_Imperial at commander rank use alt-fire now always (like in JK2)
- fixed a bug: Stormtroopers using Flechette and Repeater can now switch back to alt-fire if they switched to primary fire because the player was too close


Saber System (activated with g_saberNewCombat 1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Saber Offense gives a base "attack strength/AS" (+2/+4/+6)
- Saber Defense gives a base "defense strength/DS" (+2/+4/+6) and a number of defense points (DP;= 1 + SD level)
- AS is modified by saber style (-2/0/+2/-1/+1/-1/+1 for Fast/Med/Strong/Duals/Staff/Tavion/Desann)

How saber combat then works:
- AS > DS = attack blocked but lose DP equivalent to AS - DS
- all DP lost = guard crushed
- DPs regenerate about 1 per second if walking/standing still
- special attacks ignore DP: either crush guard or are blocked partially

Other Changes: 
- player's defense with Medium and Strong styles is improved (you can deflect slashes and blaster fire more rapidly, but still not as quickly as NPCs)
- Saber Defense 0 no longer makes you invincible to blaster fire, but blaster fire will pass through your saber
- a custom saber with "autoblocking 0" now has narrow block arc for the player (otherwise blocking is ridiculously easy);
holding Use and standing still will allow you to block in this fashion at any time

Melee changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Player can kick with any saber type, use +forcefocus to saberthrow (bind this to a key, maybe your mousewheel click-down)
- Player's melee abilities determined by Saber Offense (1 = punches and kicks, 2 = katas, 3 = spin kicks)
- if you're not cheating (using g_debugMelee or iknowkungfu)... Player melee katas have less range, must be aimed more precisely, and do not work on certain types of enemies
- Spin/Flip kicks do slightly more damage
- Spin Kicks are possible on demand with Use+AltAttack, however costs 10 FP (the auto version doesn't cost any)
- **To kick over a Jedi, must have Saber Offense >= their Saber Defense
- Player punches do 7/5 damage instead of 6/3, and aren't randomized
- **Force Speed punching should be more consistent and less cheap (never did actually test)
- **Heavy/Slow Melee is specifically associated with Chewbacca, CLASS_GRAN, and CLASS_TRANDOSHAN. Other NPC types will punch
more quickly but weakly if given WP_MELEE

Other Minor Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- visual effect for lightsaber-blocking Force Lightning, .efx file to use determined by "cg_lightningBlockEffect"
- rolls and acrobatics are possible in 1st Person now

New Modding Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- some new fields you can put in NPC files...
	dualPistols 1 -- gives an NPC dual pistols if have WP_BLASTER_PISTOL
	cortosis 1 -- cuts damage in half from lightsabers, stacks on top of any other damage reductions
	blastArmor 1 -- cuts damage in half from explosives and heavy weapons, stacks on top of any other damage reductions
	magPlating 1 -- cuts damage in half from blasters, stacks on top of any other damage reductions
	restrictJediPowers 1 -- restricts an NPC from using force powers they don't actually have (force pushing without Push 1 for example)
	altFire 1 -- this actually works now
	dontFlee 1 -- forces SCF_DONT_FLEE (an icarus script thing)
	dontFire 1 -- forces SCF_DONT_FIRE (like how melee cultists don't punch)
	rareFire 1 -- same AI as SCF_DONT_FIRE but allows punching sometimes with melee 
	heavyMelee 1 -- forces heavy melee regardless of class

- new fields are in the weapons.dat:
1.) velocity, altVelocity: use an integer number (no decimals)
2.) npcDmgMult, npcAltDmgMult, npcFireTimeMult, npcAltFireTimeMult: multipliers that use a decimal (like 0.7, 1.5, 2.3 etc.)
*read the weaponshelp.txt for overview default values for these things are

Future ideas
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things to do -
- *savegame screenshots
- *separate cvar for player HP and Shields
- force push strong version, mindtrick changes
- *camera controls (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th person)


** not completely tested but should work
*** incomplete/unfinished/not working completely
